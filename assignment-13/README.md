1. Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)

Everything I learned about Github and repositories was new because I have done very
little coding in the past. But now I have some more vocabulary and understanding
of how repositories work and how beneficial GitHub can be for coding projects.

2. Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

I already knew most of the concepts about design, media, color, and fonts, as it is taught in
previous media arts classes and I began learning about these concepts in high school when I first
became interested in design. THe problem was I didn't understand how to implement the concepts into
a website via CSS.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

This work cycle was pretty much the same as last time. I went through the website to find examples and
definitions of stuff I didn't remember and I used my previous code by gutting it and
filling it in with what I needed to complete the assignment. I just did a little
more with layout because I wanted the site to look a little more complex then my last sites. But once I
completed the layout for the site I copied the code into every other page and from there
I filled it with different content (pictures and video). It went pretty well.
