        As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
         advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice,
         among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached,
         seemed to exceed that of a man. I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes,
          and I felt a faintness seize me; but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the
          mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)
          that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving
          to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached;
          his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its
          unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed
          this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm
          him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.
        </br>
        </br>
          “Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do not you fear the fierce vengeance
          of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay that I may
          trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence,
          restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”
        </br>
        </br>
          “I expected this reception,” said the daemon. “All men hate the wretched; how, then, must
          I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me,
          thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us.
          You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine
          towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you
          at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your
           remaining friends.”
        </br>
        </br>
          “Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes: Wretched devil!
          You reproach me with your creation; come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed.”
