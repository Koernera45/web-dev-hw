1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
System fonts are already installed on the computer system while web fonts are
hosted on a server. Web-safe fonts can be counted on to be available by the system
when web fonts can't be counted on.

2. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
If the font chosen isn't able to be read and presented having other fonts to fall back to will
allow the text to show up with the backup font rather then having issues loading.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
My work cycle felt similar to the last. I just used a skeleton from a previous assignment and
began filling in the content and code/formatting/etc. to style it and make it work.
I had to look at the website to get help with some coding stuff like pseudo classes/elements.
