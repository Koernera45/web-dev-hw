<h1> Double, double toil and trouble </h1>
<h2> William Shakespeare </h2>
<hr />
<pre>
  Double, double, toil and trouble;
  Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

  Fillet of a fenny snake,
  In the cauldron boil and bake;
  Eye of newt and toe of frog,
  Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
  Adder’s fork and blind-worm’s sting,
  Lizard’s leg and owlet’s wing,
  For a charm of powerful trouble,
  Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

  Double, double, toil and trouble;
  Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

  Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
  Witches’ mummy, maw and gulf
  Of the ravin’d salt-sea shark,
  Root of hemlock digg’d i’ the dark,
  Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
  Witches’ mummy, maw and gulf
  Of the ravin’d salt-sea shark,
  Root of hemlock digg’d i’ the dark,
  Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron,
  For the ingredients of our cauldron.

  Double, double, toil and trouble;
  Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
