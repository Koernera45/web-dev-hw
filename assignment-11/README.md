3. My work cycle was pretty much the same as last time. I referred to the website
and used a little code from it. I just used a skeleton from a previous assignment and
began filling in the content and code/formatting/etc. to style it and make it work.
It was kind of a challenge to get the display inline stuff to work so I spent a lot
of time on that stuff.
