One way binary data travels on the internet is it is broken up into packets.
The packets are then sent through connections and routers, taking paths that
aren't broken or overly busy. When they arrive at their destination they are
reassembled. The destination is determine by the IP address, which the router will
direct it to.

The DNS is responsible for connecting the domain's name (which the user looks
up) and the domains IP address. The IP address is a string of long numbers,
which can be hard to remember, so having a domain name helps people find the
website by looking up the name, and the DNS finding the IP address that goes along
with it.
