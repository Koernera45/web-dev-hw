1. Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

My imaginary client was a sushi place that needed a home page, about page, services page, and contact
page. I gave them pictures and a site color scheme that matched their logo.


2. What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

Block is used to display stuff in block elements which is used to make a vertical menu. Inline is used to make the
elements act like inline elements only making them take up as much space as necessary horizontal space as needed.
Inline-block displays them inline but also forces them to obey margin and spacing.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

This work cycle was pretty much just a bigger version of every other work cycle I have wrote.
I went through the website to find examples and definitions of stuff I didn't remember and I
used my previous code by gutting it and filling it in with what I needed to complete the
assignment. I just did a little more because this assignment had a lot of parts. But once I
completed the layout for the site I copied the code into every other page and from their
I filled it with different content. It went pretty well considering how much I felt I have struggled
through some of these concepts.
