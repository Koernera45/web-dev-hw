1. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these
elements different, or what role do they play?

An html page can only have one <head> and <body> element. The head of the page will
contain the meta data or the stuff you don't see for the page, while the body contains
everything you will end up seeing on the page.

2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

Structural markup embeds the structure of the page (headings, paragraphs, etc.) while semantic
markup is used to reinforce the meaning of the information in the page.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

So I started by copying and pasting the set up for an html page (the doctype, html
heading, body) just so I had the clear outline to start. I then began writing html
to make the lists which I did by following along with what was written on the website
about the different types of lists. At the end after typing everything up I had to go
back and deal with some indenting issues because I overlooked it initially. Several
times throughout this process I opened it up in my web browser to make sure everything
looked okay!
