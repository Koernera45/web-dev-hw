1. The only forms I have experienced is contact information forms and forms for shipping
information as I do a lot of online shopping. They are set up to take my information
so that they can ship to me or help me with something (depends on why you are using the
contact form).

2. Text input can be used to type and send an email to contact the site you need something from.
Like a questions on shipping for your order or a problem with your product.
Selection button has been used to find what state you live in so you can scroll through
all the states and select which one you live in, for delivery purposes.
Button inputs are used a lot for submitting forms, and uploading files from your computer.

3. For this work cycle I went to the website to look how to format and write the code
because there was a lot of new confusing stuff for me. As I went I would load it on my
browser because I didn't want something to not work and me not realize it till the
end and have trouble figuring out what was wrong. I had to reformat a couple of times because
I am still getting used to the whole indenting and spacing used for coding.
