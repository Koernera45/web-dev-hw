1. I think for the most part most of this was difficult for me to learn. I have the fundamentals down,
like paragraphs, and breaks, and simple stuff like that. Linking photos isn't bad either.
But linking websites and other stuff gets confusing, like most of the other stuff. It all feels
pretty difficult to grasp for me and I find myself having to go back to the website a lot. I get
mostly confused by tags and syntax but I think I just need more practice with them.

2. I am anxious because so far I feel I haven't been understanding everything so moving on to something new
seems a little scary. But I do love decorating and making things look nice so hopefully that will be good!

3. I had to go back to the website a lot for this assignment as I just couldn't remember how to do
everything. But I copy and pasted the last assignment and cleared it out to start off. I had to get a friends help because
my pictures were sideways in the assignment so I had some help turning them back. We think there was a problem with the
source photos. I copy and pasted some code from older assignments but changed the content of them for some of the
requirements (like the table).
