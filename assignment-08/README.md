1. Universal selectors are used to select and style all elements on the page.
Elemental selectors are predefined selectors used to style the specific type of element.
Class selectors are ones made by the coder to style something specific whether that be one
kind of element or something else.
ID selectors are the same as class selectors as they can style a specific element.

2. The 50's had a lot pastel colors when it came to clothes, food, diners, music, etc.
So I decided to stick with that and chose a little pink, peach, and a little bit more electric teal.
a. rgb(251, 224, 203)
b. rgb(255, 198, 198)
c. rgb(55, 206, 207)

3. My work cycle is similar to my last one. I think I struggled a bit with this a bit
because there is just so much to do and remember, it can be overwhelming especially
when starting out. But I used code from previous assignments and referenced code from the website
to help me create this project today. I did good some stuff about borders because I was curious about
the different types.
