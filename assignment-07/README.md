Assignment 07

1. Spans and divs are both elements, but divs are used as divisions to separate
out content to be grouped together and styled. Spans are the inline
equivalent of divs, and you can have multiple spans in a div. They can be used
for text that needs to be emphasized or displayed differently.
An id is used to differentiate a certain element from all the other ones, usually
based on its content, and a class is used to determine a style. They are both
attributes. The class can grab and apply a style from css to whatever
element it is on.

2. Alt text is used so that something can display even if the image doesn't load,
and for people with screen readers or other issues, technical or not, that affect
their ability to see the media the alt text is on.

3. My work cycle was pretty similar to my last one. I went through the website and
then emptied it and began filling in what I needed to for this assignment. I referenced
back to the website and copy and pasted some of the code for embedding some things. Once
I had everything on the page I did mess around with colors to match the cover for the song!
